            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THE Way of Surveying will be as troublesome, and more difficult than that of the <hi>Fire-Hearth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Example.</p>
                  <p>The Houses to be Survey'd in the Cities of <hi>London, Westminster,</hi> and all other great Towns and Places in <hi>England,</hi> we will say, may have the Fronts of those Houses viewed in the Streets; but then the Doors must be opened, and the <hi>Surveyors</hi> must have leave sometimes to go through Two or Three Rooms into a fine Garden or Back-side, to inspect and take an Account of the <hi>Windows</hi> in that Part of the House, which will take up no small Time: Then the <hi>side Windows</hi> in the said House or Houses must, or ought to have a true Account taken of them; some of which looking into the Neighbours Court or Garden cannot be done without Trespassing upon them, or having leave to go into those Yards or Gardens.</p>
                  <p>Suppose Storms, or Drunken Fellows, beat down the Windows in the Streets; if so, then the <hi>Duty</hi> will be paid for nothing, in regard those <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> must be made up again, or the <hi>Proprietor</hi> have nothing for the same.</p>
                  <p>These Surveys will take up a great deal of Time, and give much Trouble (as is Humbly conceived) to the Subjects: Whereas the <hi>Duty</hi> upon <hi>Rooms</hi> will not give half a Quarter of an Hours trouble to a Family, if the Duty and House should continue for ever; so that there must be Authority given to the <hi>Surveyor,</hi> to enable him to make a true Survey, which cannot be done without the Leave and License of the Neighbours adjoyning; and how easie this will prove, we leave to better Judgments to determin.</p>
                  <p>Many other Disadvantages and Disputes will happen, if a Survey be made every Year, some Altering, others making up Windows; and it is doubted that <hi>Duty</hi> will lye very hard upon the Poorer Sort of People: But this <hi>Duty</hi> upon <hi>Rooms,</hi> the Owner has always something for his Money; and, for the most part, has all his Money repaid him again, either by Lodgers, or other Advantages, if driving Trades: Nor will the Duties on <hi>Houses</hi> and <hi>Windows,</hi> notwithstanding the Trouble, as is said before, bring in near so much Money to the <hi>King,</hi> as the Duties upon <hi>Rooms</hi> will; which may modestly be computed to Raise the Sum of <hi>Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pounds</hi> a Year, and that with as little Trouble as can be thought on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All which is Humbly submitted to the Wisdom and Determination of the Great Council of the Kingdom,</hi>

            </floatingText>
            <p>That if any shall reflect upon the Proposer, as to what is said by him, as in Relation to the Duty on <hi>Salt, &amp;c.</hi> he Humbly Prays he may have leave to answer such Objections as may be made against it; for what he hath alleadg'd is not in Prejudice to any, but that all concerned may have Justice done, as well to the <hi>Subject,</hi> as the <hi>King.</hi>
